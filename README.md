## R builds

The main purpose of this repository is to provide nightly builds of R
for the use in GitHub runners. There are two branches `devel` and
`release` which correspond to the latest published tar balls on
CRAN. The corresponding binaries are published in releases tagged as
`devel-build` and `release-build`.

Please note that this is __not__ a source repository for R - the
sources are force-pushed nightly from the CRAN tar balls and do not
include any history.
